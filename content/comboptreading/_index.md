The purpose of our reading group is for students to learn new things, gain practice presenting research to their peers, and possibly pick up a research question or two in the process.

Each semester we cover a new topic in combinatorial optimization.

**When:** Fridays at 12 pm

**Where:** MC 6029 or [Zoom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89397786681?pwd%3DejJQNXBHSS83K0tvMGtqalJqQXFlUT09&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw143mbxIM_oEZXf9bqeGXrQ) (Meeting Id: 893 9778 6681, Password: 927390)
