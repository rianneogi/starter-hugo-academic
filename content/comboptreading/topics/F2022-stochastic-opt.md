<!-- _After a brief hiatus to sort things out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CombOpt reading group is continuing its "Research Interests" series in Spring term 2020._

This term our reading group will be exploring the various research interests of students and faculty working on problems related to combinatorial optimization. If you would like to present on your recent work or a paper you find interesting please let one of the organizers know. This is a great opportunity to learn what other people working in combinatorial optimization are studying and to encourage collaboration. -->

| May 29, 2020  | Stochastic Optimization              | Ricardo Fukasawa      |While deterministic optimization problems are very useful in practice, often times the assumption that all data is known in advance does not hold true. One possible way to relax this assumption is to assume that the data depends on random variables. This assumption leads to stochastic optimization problems. In this talk, I will talk about a few different approaches on how to deal with stochastic optimization problems, with the goal to give an initial overview of several different issues that arise in these problems. | N/A
