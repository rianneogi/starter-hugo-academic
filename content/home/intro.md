<!-- **Combinatorial Optimization Reading Group** -->

The purpose of our reading group is for students to learn new things, gain practice presenting research to their peers, and possibly pick up a research question or two in the process.

The reading group is hosted by students of University of Waterloo in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization.

Each semester we cover a new topic in combinatorial optimization. [Click here](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rneogi/comb-opt-group/event/) for a list of topics that we have covered.

The **current topic** is [Stochastic Optimization](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rneogi/comb-opt-group/event/stochastic-optimization/).

**When:** Fridays at 12 pm

**Where:** MC 6029 or [Zoom](https://uwaterloo.zoom.us/j/95984766992?pwd=eldpYjBudXBrUDFwb0tkVkNHN2NXUT09) (Meeting Id: 959 8476 6992, Password: 809307)
