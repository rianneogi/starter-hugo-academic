I am a PhD student in the Combinatorics and Optimization department at the University of Waterloo. I am privileged to be working under the supervision of [Kanstantsin Pashkovich](https://kanstantsinpashkovich.bitbucket.io) and [Chaitanya Swamy](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cswamy/). My interests lie broadly in the area of combinatorial optimization.

You can contact me at \<first-name\>(dot)\<last-name\>@uwaterloo.ca
<br><br>
Together with David Aleman and Nathan Benedetto, I organise the Combinatorial Optimization Reading Group at University of Waterloo.

<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
