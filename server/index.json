A graph is k-clique-extendible if there is an ordering of the vertices such that whenever two overlapping k-cliques A and B have k−1 common vertices, and these common vertices appear between the two vertices a,b∈(A∖B)∪(B∖A) in the ordering, there is an edge between a and b, implying that A∪B is a (k+1)-clique. Such an ordering is said to be a k-C-E ordering. These graphs arise in applications related to modelling preference relations. Recently, it has been shown that a maximum clique in such a graph can be found in nO(k) time [Hamburger et al. 2017] when the ordering is given. When k is 2, such graphs are precisely the well-known class of comparability graphs and when k is 3 they are called triangle-extendible graphs. It has been shown that triangle-extendible graphs appear as induced subgraphs of visibility graphs of simple polygons, and the complexity of recognizing them has been mentioned as an open problem in the literature. While comparability graphs (i.e. 2-C-E graphs) can be recognized in polynomial time, we show that recognizing k-C-E graphs is NP-hard for any fixed k≥3 and CO-NP-hard when k is part of the input. While our NP-hardness reduction for k≥4 is from the betweenness problem, for k=3, our reduction is an intricate one from the 3-colouring problem. We also show that the problems of determining whether a given ordering of the vertices of a graph is a k-C-E ordering, and that of finding a maximum clique in a k-C-E graph, given a k-C-E ordering, are hard for the parameterized complexity classes CO-W[1] and W[1] respectively, when parameterized by k. However we show that the former is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph. We also show that the dual parameterizations of all the problems that we study are fixed parameter tractable.","tags":["Parameterized Complexity"],"title":"Recognizing k-Clique Extendible Orderings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rian Neogi","M S Ramanujan","Saket Saurabh","Roohani Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"a7aced4c8069bea18a1be874ced823b4","permalink":"http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rneogi/publication/hscc_mfcs/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~rneogi/publication/hscc_mfcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) is a fundamental computational problem that has received extensive attention in parameterized complexity. In this paper, we initiate the study of a wide generalization, the H-free SCC Deletion problem. Here, one is given a digraph D, an integer k and the objective is to decide whether there is a vertex set of size at most k whose deletion leaves a digraph where every strong component excludes graphs in the fixed finite family H as (not necessarily induced) subgraphs. When H comprises only the digraph with a single arc, then this problem is precisely DFVS. Our main result is a proof that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size of the deletion set if H only contains rooted graphs or if H contains at least one directed path. Along with generalizing the fixed-parameter tractability result for DFVS, our result also generalizes the recent results of G¨oke et al. [CIAC 2019] for the 1-Out-Regular Vertex Deletion and Bounded Size Strong Component Vertex Deletion problems. Moreover, we design algorithms for the two above mentioned problems, whose running times are better and match with the best bounds for DFVS, without using the heavy machinery of shadow removal as is done by G¨oke et al.

The König Edge Deletion problem asks if in a given graph there exists a set of at most k edges whose deletion results in a König graph. While the vertex version of the problem (König vertex deletion) has been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable more than a decade ago, the fixed-parameter-tractability of the König Edge Deletion problem has been open since then, and has been conjectured to be W[1]-hard in several papers. In this paper, we settle the conjecture by proving it W[1]-hard. We prove that a variant of this problem, where we are given a graph G and a maximum matching M and we want a k-sized König edge deletion set that is disjoint from M, is fixed-parameter-tractable.","tags":["Parameterized Complexity"],"title":"Tractability of König edge deletion problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After a brief hiatus to sort things out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CombOpt reading group is continuing its “Research Interests” series in Spring term 2020.\nThis term our reading group will be exploring the various research interests of students and faculty working on problems related to combinatorial optimization.
