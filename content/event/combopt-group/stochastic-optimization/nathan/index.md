# summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'The mean and variance of a probability distribution may not reflect
what one wants from a scenario involving uncertainty.
In particular, such measures fall short of expressing risk in a way
suitable for financial and similar applications.

In this talk we will discuss two measures of risk: Value-at-Risk and
Conditional Value-at-Risk, as well as their connection to convex
optimization.'
